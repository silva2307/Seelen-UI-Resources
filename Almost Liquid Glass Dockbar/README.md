A refined, high-fidelity dockbar theme inspired by the AppleOS26 Beta Release 1, this design captures the ethereal essence of Apple’s latest UI philosophy: liquid translucency, soft gradients, and dynamic light behavior.  
(Almost) Liquid Glass Dockbar blends precision with poetry — featuring customizable blur, brightness, glow, and border radius — all layered under animated reflections and fluid noise patterns that mimic the way real glass reacts to ambient light.  
Built upon AppleOS26’s “Liquid Continuity” design language — where interfaces feel organic, responsive, and alive — this dockbar brings that same futuristic elegance to Seelen UI. 
Each glow, shimmer, and light shift evokes Apple’s signature motion design: subtle, immersive, and breathtakingly fluid.  But it’s not just about looks — it’s about control. 
This theme offers deep customization:  
🎨 Change the dock’s background color and the highlight color behind icons  
🌈 Adjust the reflection color, glow opacity, and glow intensity  
🕒 Control the animation speed of the moving light  
🧩 Tweak the border radius of the dock in real-time  A fluid experience, wrapped in glass — and shaped entirely by you.
